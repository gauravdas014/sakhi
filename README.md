With the evolution of technology, everything is going online. Online market is really popular today. It's good. But what about those who are still unaware of the online world ? What about those who still believes offline market is the only market? What about them who don't know English to use the online markets available out there? In this hackathon we the team of 5 people have come up with a solution. Our motive is to make the life of rural people simpler by allowing them operate the things with their own comfort, sell their own products and earn money. Sounds interesting , yes it is. Today, when English is the basic requirement for using the online services we have developed and E-commerce system which will be in regional languages. The people from rural areas are unaware of the fact that the things they can create using bamboo, wood, and other such materials which are easily available to them can bring a lot of money to them and they can create a business. Our idea is to create an regional online marketplace. It will definitely be an step towards solving the problem of unemployment of rural women.
