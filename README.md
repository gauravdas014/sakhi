With the evolution of technology, everything is going online. Online market is really popular today. It's good. But what about those who are still unaware of the online world ? What about those who still believe that offline market is the only market? What about those who are deprived of using such platforms due to language?

‘Sashakt Mahila, Sashakt Bharat’, that is the ideology with which the Indian government works towards the upliftment of rural women in the country. We took a look at how intrinsically _Indian women are involved in heritage arts and crafts_, and _why saving and developing one would automatically benefit the other_.
According to the Indian handicrafts census, 56.13 per cent of artisans are women.
The Unemployment Rate (UR) for women in the rural population is 47/1000 which is significantly higher when compared to male UR standing at 21/10003.

In this hackathon we the _Team Quintuple_ of 5 passionate developers have come up with a solution to empower the talented women from rural areas whose work usually go unnoticed at large. Our motive is to build a platform to showcase the artwork, artefacts, pottery, crafts by rural women for the world to recognize, appreciated and buy.This way we aim to eradicate the unemployment amongst them and provide them economical and social enhancement.
Few examples of daily chores practised by rural-women that need to find their representation on the crafts atlas of India are:

- Vegetable colours and exquisite ‘Lambani’ crafts from Karnataka
- Bottle gourd/Sponge guard lamps, or ‘Tuma’ crafts from Chattisgarh
- Rice Jewellery from Tamil Nadu
- Earthy screw pine crafts of Kerala
- ‘Chunar’ red clay pottery from Mirzapur, Uttar Pradesh

Sounds interesting , yes it is. Today, when English is the basic requirement for using the online services, we have developed an E-commerce system which can be handled in regional languages. Our idea is to create an _regional online marketplace_. It will definitely be a step towards solving the problem of unemployment of rural women.
